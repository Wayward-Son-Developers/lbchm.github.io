# Who We Support

## Wells of Living Water International

![image-left](/assets/images/wolwi_logo.png){: .align-left}
[Wells of Living Water International](http://www.wellsoflivingwater.org/) is a group of concerned Christians who became aware of the great need for clean water in the villages devestated by the earth quake of 2007 in Peru.  After an initial visit in person, members of the team felt the call to go back to the US and establish a non-profit mission to help meet the need.

The purpose and mission of Wells of Living Water International, Inc. shall be to promote the establishment of local, New Testament, churches that will evangelize unbelievers and disciple believers through the drilling and maintenance of water wells and other types of humanitarian aid to international communities in need worldwide.
