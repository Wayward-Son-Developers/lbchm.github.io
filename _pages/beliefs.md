# What We Believe

## Statement of Faith

The purpose of Lighthouse Baptist Church is the glorification of God in the salvation of souls, the edification of Christians through the teaching and preaching of God&rsquo;s Word, the worldwide proclamation of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the promotion of Godly worship, the ordination of ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the contending for &ldquo;The Faith Once Delivered&rdquo;, and cooperation with Christian activity in harmony with God&rsquo;s Holy Word, the Bible, until the return of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1. **The Holy Scriptures:**
We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the verbally and plenary inspired Word of God. We believe God&rsquo;s Word is the final authority of faith and practice.<br />(1 Corinthians 2:13; 10:11; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21)
2. **The Godhead:**
We believe in the one triune God, eternally existing in three persons &ndash; Father, Son and Holy Spirit &ndash; co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, having the same attributes and perfections. He is Almighty, infallible, unchangeable, infinately wise, just, and Holy.<br />(Gen. 1:1; Ex. 20:2-3; Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19; John 14:10, 26; 10:30; 1 Cor. 8:6; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 4:11)
3. **The Person and Work of Jesus Christ:**
    a. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God. He became man while at the same time did not cease to become God. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men.<br />(Is. 7:14; 9:6; Luke 1:35; John 1:1-2, 14; 2 Cor. 5:19-21; Gal. 4:4-5; Phil. 2:5-8)
    b. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through His death on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice. Our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead.<br />(Acts 2:18-36; Rom. 3:24-25; Eph. 1:7; 1 Peter 1:3-5; 1 Peter 2:24)
    c. We believe that our Lord rose from the dead, according to the Scriptures, and in the same body, though glorified, in which He had lived and died, and that His resurrection body is the pattern of that body which, at the return of Christ, will be given to all resurrected believers.<br />(Luke 24:36-43; John 20:20; Acts 2:32; 1 Cor. 15:23, 42-45; Phil. 2:20-21)
    d. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate.<br />(Acts 1:9-10; Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25; 9:24; 1 John 2:1-2)
4. **The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit:**
    a. We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person who convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment; and, that He is the Supernatural Agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption.<br />(John 16:8-11; Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 12:13; 2 Cor. 3:6; Eph. 1:13-14)
    b. We believe that He is the divine Teacher who assists believers to understand and approptiate the Scriptures and that it is the privilege and duty of all saved to be filled with the Spirit.<br />(Eph. 1:17-18; 5:18; 1 John 2:20, 27)
    c. We believe that the sign gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and the gift of healing were temporary. Speaking in tongues was never the common or necessary sign of the baptism or filling of the Holy Spirit.<br />(1 Cor. 1:22; 13:8; 14:21-22)
5. **The Total Depravity of Man:**
We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God; but that in Adam&rsquo;s sin the human race fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became alienated from God and subject to the power of the Devil. This sin nature was passed down to succeeding generations and no one is immune except Jesus Christ the sinless Son of God. Man is totally depraved and, of himself, utterly unable to remedy his lost condition.<br />(Gen. 1:26-27; Rom. 3:22-23; 5:12; 6:23; Eph. 2:1-3; 4:17-19)
6. **Salvation:**
We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins. All who repent from sin and believe and trust in the finished work of Jesus Christ are justified and will never be turned away. We believe that all sins, except the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, are forgivable.<br />(Matt. 12:31-32; John 1:12; Eph. 1:7; 2:8-10; 1 Peter 1:18-19; 1 John 1:9)
7. **The Eternal Security and Assurance of Believers:**
    a. We believe that all the redeemed, once saved are kept by God&rsquo;s power and are thus secure in Christ forever.<br />(John 6:37-40; 10:27-30; Rom. 8:1, 38-39; 1 Cor. 1:4-8; 1 Peter 1:4-5)
    b. We believe that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God&rsquo;s Word, which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh.<br />(Rom. 13:13-14; Gal. 5:13; Titus 2:11-15)
8. **The Church:**
    a. We believe that the local church, which is the body and the espoused bride of Christ, is solely made up of born-again persons.<br />(1 Cor. 12:12-14; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 1:22-23; 5:25-27)
    b. We believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in New Testament Scriptures.<br />(Acts 14:27; 20:17, 28-32; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-11)
    c. We believe in the autonomy of the local church free of any external authority or control.<br />(Acts 13:1-4; 15:19-31; 20:28; Rom. 16:1, 4; 1 Cor. 3:9, 16; 5:4-7, 13; 1Peter 5:1-4)
    d. We recognize water baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper as the Scriptural ordinances of obedience for the church in this age. The local body is to determine the frequency of communion and baptism is to be by immersion.<br />(Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 2:41-42; 8:36-38; 1 Cor. 11:23-26)
9. **Creation:**
We believe that God created the universe in six literal, 24 hour periods. We reject evolution, the Gap Theory, the Day-Age theory, and Theistic Evolution as unscriptural theories of origin.<br />(Gen. 1-2; Ex.20:11)
