# Who We Are

## Our Church
At Lighthouse Baptist Church our main goal is to preach Christ and Him crucified. We are a body of believers that has a desire for people to come to know Christ, and to grow spiritually through the expositional teaching and preaching of God's word.

Our mission statement is three-fold:
 - Magnify Christ through worship and His Word.
 - Make Christ known to our neighbors and the World.
 - Move believers towards living a Christ-like life and to serve in Ministry.

We want every member to have the attitude of &ldquo;I am saved to serve.&rdquo;
